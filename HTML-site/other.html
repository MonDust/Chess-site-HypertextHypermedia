						<h3>History</h3>
						<div class="text">
							The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years to its earliest known predecessor, called chaturanga, in India; its prehistory is the subject of speculation. 
							From India it spread to Persia. 
							Following the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Spain and the rest of Southern Europe. 
							The game evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500 CE.
							"Romantic chess" was the predominant playing style from the late 18th century to the 1880s. 
							Chess games of this period emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning. 
							The Romantic era of play was followed by the Scientific, Hypermodern, and New Dynamism eras. 
							In the second half of the 19th century, modern chess tournament play began, and the first official World Chess Championship was held in 1886. 
							The 20th century saw great leaps forward in chess theory and the establishment of the World Chess Federation. 
							In 1997, an IBM supercomputer beat Garry Kasparov, the then world chess champion, in the famous Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov match, ushering the game into an era of computer domination. 
							Since then, computer analysis - which originated in the 1970s with the first programmed chess games on the market - has contributed to much of the development in chess theory and has become an important part of preparation in professional human chess. 
							Later developments in the 21st century made the use of computer analysis far surpassing the ability of any human player accessible to the public. 
							Online gaming, which first appeared in the mid-1990s, also became popular in the 21st century.

							<div>Precursors to chess originated in India. There, its early form in the 7th century CE was known as chaturaṅga, which translates to "four divisions (of the military)": infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry. These forms are represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.

								Chess was introduced to Persia from India and became a part of the princely or courtly education of Persian nobility. Around 600 CE in Sassanid Persia, the name for the game became chatrang (Persian: چترنگ), which subsequently evolved to shatranj (Arabic: شطرنج; Persian: شترنج) after the conquest of Persia by the Rashidun Caliphate, due to the lack of native ch and ng sounds in the Arabic language. The rules were developed further during this time; players started calling "Shāh!" (Persian for "King!") when attacking the opponent's king, and "Shāh Māt!" (Persian for "the king is helpless" – see checkmate) when the king was attacked and could not escape from attack. These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands.
								
								The game was taken up by the Muslim world after the early Arab Muslims conquered the Sassanid Empire, with the pieces largely keeping their Persian names. The Moors of North Africa rendered the Persian term "shatranj" as shaṭerej, which gave rise to the Spanish acedrex, axedrez and ajedrez; in Portuguese it became xadrez, and in Greek zatrikion (ζατρίκιον), but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh ("king"). Thus, the game came to be called lūdus scacc(h)ōrum or scacc(h)ī in Latin, scacchi in Italian, escacs in Catalan, échecs in French (Old French eschecs), schaken in Dutch, Schach in German, szachy in Polish, šahs in Latvian, skak in Danish, sjakk in Norwegian, schack in Swedish, šakki in Finnish, šah in South Slavic languages, sakk in Hungarian and şah in Romanian; there are two theories about why this change happened:
								
								From the exclamation "check" or "checkmate" as it was pronounced in various languages.
								From the first chessmen known of in Western Europe (except Iberia and Greece) being ornamental chess kings brought in as curios by Muslim traders.
								The Mongols call the game shatar, and in Ethiopia it is called senterej, both evidently derived from shatranj.
								
								Chess spread directly from the Middle East to Russia, where chess became known as шахматы (shakhmaty, literally "checkmates", a plurale tantum).
								
								The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000 it had spread throughout Europe. Introduced into the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors in the 10th century, it was described in a famous 13th-century Spanish manuscript covering shatranj, backgammon and dice named the Libro de los juegos, which is the earliest European treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables games.
								
								Chess spread throughout the world and many variants of the game soon began taking shape.Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders and others carried it to the Far East where it was transformed and assimilated into a game often played on the intersection of the lines of the board rather than within the squares.Chaturanga reached Europe through Persia, the Byzantine empire and the expanding Arabian empire.Muslims carried chess to North Africa, Sicily, and Iberia by the 10th century.
								
								The game was developed extensively in Europe. By the late 15th century, it had survived a series of prohibitions and Christian Church sanctions to almost take the shape of the modern game. Modern history saw reliable reference works, competitive chess tournaments, and exciting new variants. These factors added to the game's popularity, further bolstered by reliable timing mechanisms (first introduced in 1861), effective rules, and charismatic players.

						<h3>Most famous chess tournaments</h3>
						<div class="text">
							<ul>
								<li>The Candidates Tournament
								<p class="text"><br>This special tournament is only for those invited respectively qualified. The winner of this tournament has the right to take part in the World Championship against the current world champion (currently Magnus Carlsen). The tournament system has changed over the years, but the principle is clear - to identify the challenger in the fight for the world championship title. The Candidates Tournament could be entered from so-called interzonal tournaments. Today, the system is more complicated. The first two players of the FIDE Grand Prix Chess Series go to this tournament, the unsuccessful challenger for the world championship, the first two chess players from the World Cup, 2 players with the highest ELO rating and one chess player who is determined by "wild card".<br></p></li>
